    "## Mean Reversion Trading Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean reversion is a trading strategy based on the belief that prices or tend to move towards their historical average over time. This strategy assumes that when prices deviate too far from their mean, they are likely to revert back.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is rooted in the understanding that markets often have short-term price fluctuations or overreactions due to factors such news events, investor behavior and so on. However, these price movements are expected to be temporary, and eventually, prices will return to their long-term average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean reversion strategies typically involve the following approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Buy low, sell high**: When an asset's price falls significantly below its historical mean, traders may consider buying the asset with the expectation that it will revert back to its average. Once the price returns to a more normalized level, they may sell the asset to capture the profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Short-selling**: Conversely, if an asset's price rises excessively above its historical mean, traders may consider shorting the asset, expecting the price to decline and revert back to its mean. They can buy back the asset at a lower price to cover their short position and generate a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical indicators**: Mean reversion strategies often utilize statistical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, or moving averages to identify overbought or oversold conditions. These indicators help traders identify potential opportunities to enter or exit positions based on the expectation of mean reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pairs trading**: Another popular mean reversion strategy is pairs trading, which involves identifying two closely related securities that have historically exhibited a high correlation. When the price relationship between the two securities diverges significantly from their historical mean, traders can take long and short positions simultaneously, expecting the prices to converge back to their average relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean reversion strategies come with their own set of risks, including the possibility of extended periods of divergence from the mean or the presence of fundamental shifts that invalidate the mean reversion hypothesis. Therefore, thorough analysis, risk management, and continuous monitoring are crucial when implementing mean reversion strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to tailor the strategy to your specific trading goals and risk tolerance, and to continuously evaluate and adapt your approach based on market conditions and new information."
